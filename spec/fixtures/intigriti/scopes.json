Please send vulnerability reports against those products to their respective product security team. This list is not complete but may be used as a guide:\n* McAfee - https://www.mcafee.com/us/threat-center/product-security-bulletins.aspx\n* Wind River - https://www.windriver.com/psirt-policy\n* BlueZ - http://www.bluez.org/development/security-bugs/\n\n## Duplicate Reports\nVulnerabilities already known to Intel fall out of Scope and are not eligible for rewards. This includes both internally identified and externally reported vulnerabilities.\n\n## Intel Open/Prototyping Platforms\nIntel products intended for prototyping use or that are “open” to provide customers with debugging capability are out of Scope for bounty rewards.\n\n## Open Chassis Physical Attacks\nSubmissions that require an attacker to physically open the case, including removing screws or breaking plastic casing (open chassis) to gain access to the internal hardware of a device are out of scope for bounty rewards.\n\n## Owner-Attacker & Physical Access Attacks\nValid submissions against firmware weaknesses requiring physical access or UEFI shell, are out of scope for bounty rewards. \nOperating System access attacks such as Malicious Kernel are generally considered in scope. Weaknesses found in out-of-band management solutions such as BMC, CSME or similar are generally in scope for bounty rewards. \n\n## Pre-Release Products\nVulnerabilities in pre-release product versions (e.g., Beta, Release Candidate) fall out of Scope for bounty rewards.\n\n",

You are not currently, nor have you been under contract to Intel Corporation, or an Intel subsidiary, within 6 months prior to submitting a report.\n7. You are neither a family nor household member of any individual who currently or within the past 6 months meets or met the criteria listed in the two bullet points directly above.\n8. You agree to participate in testing mitigation effectiveness and coordinating disclosure/release/publication of your finding with Intel.\n9. You did not and will not access any personal information that is not your own, including by exploiting the vulnerability. \n10. You did not and will not violate any applicable law or regulation, including laws prohibiting unauthorized access to information. To clarify, Intel does not view testing that is done in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Bug Bounty Program as unauthorized. \n11. There may be additional restrictions on your eligibility to participate in the bug bounty depending upon your local laws.\n\n\nIf at any point while researching a vulnerability, you are unsure whether you should continue, immediately send a message to Intel PSIRT (secure@intel.com).\n\n## Sensitive and Personal Information\nNever attempt to access anyone else's data or personal information, including by exploiting a vulnerability. Such activity is unauthorized. If during your research, testing, or communication with Intel you interacted with or obtained access to data or personal information of others, you must:\n* Stop your testing immediately and cease any activity that involves the data or personal information or the vulnerability.\n* Do not save, copy, store, transfer, disclose, or otherwise retain the data or personal information.\n* Alert Intel immediately and support our investigation and mitigation efforts.\n\nFailure to comply with any of the above will immediately disqualify any report from bounty award eligibility.\n\n\n# Intel Agreements\n## Bounties\nBounty award arrangements under this program, including the timing, bounty amount and form of payments, are at Intel’s sole discretion and will be made case-by-case following the principle of **One CVE = One Bounty**.\n\nIntel’s bug bounty awards **range from $500 up to $100,000**. We consider a range of factors when determining the award amount for eligible reports. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the quality of the report, impact of the potential vulnerability, type of vulnerability, CVSS severity score, whether a POC was provided and the quality of the POC (see “**Report Eligibility Criteria**” section). The table below is a general guide to the potential award amounts. However, the awards may vary based on the factors mentioned.\n\n\n| Vulnerability Severity | CVSS Score Range | Intel Software| Intel Firmware | Intel Hardware |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Up to $10,000 | Up to $30,000 | Up to $100,000 |\n| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | Up to $5,000 | Up to $15,000 | Up to $30,000 |\n| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | Up to $1,500 | Up to $3,000 | Up to $5,000 |\n| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | Up to $500 | Up to $1,000 | Up to $2,000 |\n\nIntel, at its sole discretion, may reject any submission that we determine does not meet the “**Security Researcher and Reporter Eligibility Criteria**,” “**Product Eligibility Criteria**,“ or “**Report Eligibility Criteria**” sections or that are deemed as ineligible as set forth below.\nIntel makes no representations regarding the tax consequences of the payments Intel makes under this program. Participants in this program are responsible for any tax liability associated with bounty award payments.\n\n## Current Standards in Use\n* Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1)\n* CVE Numbering Authority Rules: [Version 3.0](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna/CNA_Rules_v3.0.pdf)\n\n## Safe Harbor\nIf you follow the program terms, we will not initiate a lawsuit or law enforcement investigation against you in response to your report. Please understand that this waiver does not apply to your security research that involves the networks, systems, information, applications, devices, products, or services of another party (which is not Intel). We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities.\n\n\n# Shared Agreements\n## Intellectual Property\nBy submitting your content to Intel (your “Submission”), you agree that Intel may take all steps needed to validate, mitigate, and disclose the vulnerability, and that you grant Intel all rights to your Submission needed to do so.\n\nIntel will, to the best of its ability, offer named acknowledgement on any Intel publications which include information provided through the reporting process. For Submissions with multiple collaborators, please ensure all users are included on the report at the time of submission to ensure acknowledgement.\n\nAcknowledgements will utilize the bug bounty platform username only, unless otherwise requested at the time of submission, or anonymity if requested before publication occurs. Limits may apply. Intel will not edit the acknowledged name unless it can be proven to be inaccurate.",

If during your research, testing, or communication with Intel you interacted with or obtained access to data or personal information of others, you must:\n* Stop your testing immediately and cease any activity that involves the data or personal information or the vulnerability.\n* Do not save, copy, store, transfer, disclose, or otherwise retain the data or personal information.\n* Alert Intel immediately and support our investigation and mitigation efforts.\n\nFailure to comply with any of the above will immediately disqualify any report from bounty award eligibility.\n\n\n# Intel Agreements\n## Bounties\nBounty award arrangements under this program, including the timing, bounty amount and form of payments, are at Intel’s sole discretion and will be made case-by-case following the principle of **One CVE = One Bounty**.\n\nIntel’s bug bounty awards **range from $500 up to $100,000**. We consider a range of factors when determining the award amount for eligible reports. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the quality of the report, impact of the potential vulnerability, type of vulnerability, CVSS severity score, whether a POC was provided and the quality of the POC (see “**Report Eligibility Criteria**” section). The table below is a general guide to the potential award amounts. However, the awards may vary based on the factors mentioned.\n\n\n| Vulnerability Severity | CVSS Score Range | Intel Software| Intel Firmware | Intel Hardware |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Up to $10,000 | Up to $30,000 | Up to $100,000 |\n| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | Up to $5,000 | Up to $15,000 | Up to $30,000 |\n| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | Up to $1,500 | Up to $3,000 | Up to $5,000 |\n| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | Up to $500 | Up to $1,000 | Up to $2,000 |\n\nIntel, at its sole discretion, may reject any submission that we determine does not meet the “**Security Researcher and Reporter Eligibility Criteria**,” “**Product Eligibility Criteria**,“ or “**Report Eligibility Criteria**” sections or that are deemed as ineligible as set forth below.\nIntel makes no representations regarding the tax consequences of the payments Intel makes under this program. Participants in this program are responsible for any tax liability associated with bounty award payments.\n\n## Current Standards in Use\n* Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1)\n* CVE Numbering Authority Rules: [Version 3.0](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna/CNA_Rules_v3.0.pdf)\n\n## Safe Harbor\nIf you follow the program terms, we will not initiate a lawsuit or law enforcement investigation against you in response to your report. Please understand that this waiver does not apply to your security research that involves the networks, systems, information, applications, devices, products, or services of another party (which is not Intel). We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities.\n\n\n# Shared Agreements\n## Intellectual Property\nBy submitting your content to Intel (your “Submission”), you agree that Intel may take all steps needed to validate, mitigate, and disclose the vulnerability, and that you grant Intel all rights to your Submission needed to do so.\n\nIntel will, to the best of its ability, offer named acknowledgement on any Intel publications which include information provided through the reporting process. For Submissions with multiple collaborators, please ensure all users are included on the report at the time of submission to ensure acknowledgement.\n\nAcknowledgements will utilize the bug bounty platform username only, unless otherwise requested at the time of submission, or anonymity if requested before publication occurs. Limits may apply. Intel will not edit the acknowledged name unless it can be proven to be inaccurate.",
